## Directory Responsibilities

- **public/**: Static files served directly. Place images, icons, and robots.txt here.
- **src/components/**: All UI components.  
  - **ui/**: Contains atomic and composite UI components.  
  - *Group related components into subdirectories if they share a domain or feature (e.g., `form/`, `charts/`).*
- **src/hooks/**: Custom React hooks. Each file should export a single hook focused on one responsibility.
- **src/lib/**: Utility functions and libraries that are not React components or hooks.
- **src/pages/**: All route-level pages.  
  - *Each page should have its own subdirectory if it contains more than a single file or has related logic/components.*
- **src/App.tsx**: Sets up global providers.
- **src/router.tsx**: Sets up routing.
- **src/main.tsx**: Application entry point.

**Important:**
Whenever a new module (such as a component, hook, or utility) or a new page is added or removed, this document **must be updated immediately** to reflect the changes. Keeping this documentation up to date ensures that all collaborators have a clear understanding of the current project structure and its intended organization.

## How to Add New Code

### 1. Adding a New Page

- **Create a subdirectory under `src/pages/` for each new page.**
  - Example: For a "Dashboard" page, create `src/pages/dashboard/`.
- **Place the main page component as `index.tsx` inside the subdirectory.**
- **Add any page-specific components or logic in the same subdirectory.**
- **Register the new route in `src/router.tsx and generate a semantic name.**
  - Example:
    ```tsx
    import Dashboard from "./pages/dashboard";
    // ...
    {
      path: "/dashboard",
      name: 'dashboard',
      element: <Dashboard />
    }
    ```

### 2. Adding a New Component

- **If you are adding a group of related components, create a subdirectory (e.g., `form/`, `charts/`).**
- **If the component is only used by a specific page, place it in that page's subdirectory under `src/pages/`.**
- **Each component should be focused on a single responsibility.**
- **Small files (< 100 lines) are encouraged for a single component.**

### 3. Adding a New Hook

- **Create a new file in `src/hooks/` named after the hook (e.g., `use-feature.ts`).**
- **Each file should export only one hook.**
- **Hooks should be as small and focused as possible.**

### 4. Adding Utilities

- **Add utility functions to `src/lib/`.**
- **Group related utilities in the same file or subdirectory if needed.**

## Coding Best Practices

- **One module, one responsibility:**  
  Each file (component, hook, utility) should do one thing only.
- **High cohesion, low coupling:**  
  Keep related logic together and avoid unnecessary dependencies between modules.
- **Naming conventions:**  
  - Use `PascalCase` for components and page directories.
  - Use `camelCase` for hooks and utility functions.
  - Name page subdirectories and files after their route or feature.
- **Component structure:**  
  - Keep components small and focused.
  - Extract subcomponents if a component grows too large.
- **Page structure:**  
  - Place all logic, hooks, and components specific to a page in its subdirectory.
  - Only share code via `components/`, `hooks/`, or `lib/` if it is truly reusable.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Add comments for complex logic.
  - Document the purpose of each module at the top of the file if not obvious.

## Example: Adding a New "Profile" Page

1. **Create a directory:**  
   `src/pages/profile/`
2. **Add the main page component:**  
   `src/pages/profile/index.tsx`
3. **Add page-specific components:**  
   `src/pages/profile/ProfileHeader.tsx`, `src/pages/profile/ProfileDetails.tsx`
4. **Register the route in `App.tsx`:**
   ```tsx
   import Profile from "./pages/profile";
   // ...
   <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
   ```
5. **If you need a reusable button, add it to `src/components/ui/button.tsx`.**
